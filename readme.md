## Translations

For anyone who's interested in working on translating this site, please look into the /lang/ directory of this repository. There are some sample translation JSON files there. To start, just make a copy of the en.json file and start filling it out.

**Please note:** The canonical version of the site text is contained in index.html. The strings contained in the `xx.json` files may be out of date, as they need to be updated manually (and I don't have unlimited amounts of free time). Please refer to the text contained in index.html when developing your translations to ensure your translation file is up-to-date.

Bear in mind that the site is being constantly updated, so you may want to check back every so often.

### Adding your own JSON stubs

You may find that a particular string of text, e.g. `"i18n-whonix-desc"`, does not exist in your preferred language's JSON file. Feel free to add it to your file, just like this:

    "i18n-whonix-desc": "Your fantastic translation here.",

## CSS editing

Please do not edit the `screen.css` file directly, but instead edit the `.stylus` files found in `assets/styl/`. To compile the Stylus code into CSS, you'll need to run this terminal command from the project root:

    stylus -w -c assets/styl/screen.styl -o assets/css -u ~/local/node/lib/node_modules/nib

If you don't have the [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/) package just install it (along with the [nib](http://visionmedia.github.io/nib/)) extension `npm`:

    npm install -g stylus nib
